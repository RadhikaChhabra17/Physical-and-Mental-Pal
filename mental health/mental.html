              <p>Health care professionals have differing opinions on the effectiveness of medication to treat mental
                illness. There are treatment facilities like The San Joaquin Psychotherapy Center,<span> <a

                for
                medication-free treatment for many mental health illnesses. Mental illness is a medical illness. A
                person does not simply "get over" mental illness without some form of treatment. Mental illness is
                generally a lifelong, chronic medical illness that needs consistent treatment. </p>

              <p>Though medications can often aid in the treatment of mental illness, it is unlikely that taking
                medication as the sole form of treatment will be effective in "getting over" or stabilizing one's mental
                illness. Professionals generally recommend therapy along with medications to manage mental illness most
                effectively. </p>
              <p>People who suffer the mental illness of severe depression may put pressure on themselves to just "get
                over" return to active participation again, but like other mental illnesses, it takes therapy and
                sometimes medication to stabilize.</p>

              <p>Mental illness can often disrupt a person's life by hindering that person's ability to focus on and
                complete tasks that they otherwise would be able to complete. Establishing a productive daily routine
                can help to normalize that person's daily life and having a routine most often contributes to increased
                life satisfaction that comes with personal accomplishment (in the human population as a whole, not just

                The decision to take prescription medication is one that every individual must make for his or herself.
                Some people do not feel comfortable divulging information to doctors or others living with mental
                illness in a therapy environment so they choose to rely solely on medication to combat the disturbances
                in their lives caused by mental illness. The question of whether it is safe to take prescription
                medication without partaking in therapy can best be answered by stating that it might be less effective
                to take medication without the benefit of therapy, but it does not seem to have been proven to be
                unsafe.

                By itself, exercise is unlikely to control many types of mental illness. Many health care professionals
                think that physical exercise has a positive effect on depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses,
                though all caution that more clinical research must be done on the subject. There does seem to be a
                large section of the medical community that believes physical exercise, in conjunction with therapy and
                prescription medication, is very beneficial to persons living with mental illnesses, as it is for all
                people

                The types of mental illness and the percentage of the population with each illness is the same across
                cultures. Cultures vary in how mental illness is stigmatized, beliefs about the cause of mental illness,
                and response to different treatments. Mental Health professionals from many different fields differ in
                their opinions on this and related questions. One argument is that people with lower economic and social
                status (not ethnicity) are possibly more likely to develop mental illness due to the barriers to
                advancement implicit in those groups' social stature.
